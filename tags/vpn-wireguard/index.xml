      <description>I recently started to fall in love with the new VPN wireguard. For you that does not know, wireguard is a cool new VPN technology that is only around ~4000 lines of code. Not only that; its super fast, overtakingopenVPN protocol bseveral leauges. It is also multicore, which is always nice.
Wireguard uses the ChaCha20 encryption protocol for all its goodiness. I must say however, since the protocol is fairly new, it is not deemd as &amp;ldquo;secure&amp;rdquo; as openVPN or IPSEC.</description>
