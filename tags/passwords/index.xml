      <description>Something that really grinds my gears is people who still recomennds super complex passwords. I mean come on, it&amp;rsquo;s 2018 for christs sake.

Just because one pumps a password full with exclamation points, offerings to the devil and half a can of tuna, does not make it a good password. Super complicated passwords such as !#121dsSDA32jKCS(9&amp;rdquo;###!&amp;ldquo;SDd2 is just to much for the simple human mind to handle.</description>
