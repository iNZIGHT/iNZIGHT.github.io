<meta name="twitter:description" content="I recently started to fall in love with the new VPN wireguard. For you that does not know, wireguard is a cool new VPN technology that is only around ~4000 lines of code. Not only that; its super fast, overtakingopenVPN protocol bseveral leauges. It is also multicore, which is always nice.
Wireguard uses the ChaCha20 encryption protocol for all its goodiness. I must say however, since the protocol is fairly new, it is not deemd as &ldquo;secure&rdquo; as openVPN or IPSEC."/>

<p>Wireguard uses the ChaCha20 encryption protocol for all its goodiness. I must say however, since the protocol is fairly new, it is not deemd as &ldquo;secure&rdquo; as openVPN or IPSEC. If you plan to do very suspicious activities I would not reccommend wireguard. However, if you only want some privacy or a decent vpn tunnel to your home network, wireguard for the mean time, works absolutly marvelous</p>
