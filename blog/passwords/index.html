The old password laws are dead, please just accept that. Just because one pumps a password full with exclamation points, offerings to the devil and half a can of tuna, does not make it a good password.
Super complicated passwords such as !#121dsSDA32jKCS(9&quot;###!&ldquo;SDd2 are just to much for the simple human mind to handle. Especially when we need to have thirty of them, all different.
Instead, why not use a <em>longer</em> password? No need for fancy spinning rims or all flavoured icecream. An excellent comic on this is over at <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">https://xkcd.com/936/</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to avoid the hustle of remebering 50 different passwords like me, just use a password manager. This way, you only have to remember one good strong password. Combine this with 2FA hardware token (I use yubikey) and you are good to go.</p>
<p>Yours,
Adam</p>
